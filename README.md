# **APP Machine Learning**

This is an application created by **EMCODY**. It is a web platform who has the purpose help other developers.

Now, In this app, you will find examples of predictive models apply **machine learning**. We are consume an API ML and create an API REST with Node.js.

> In the **Titanic** section we use a machine learning model to predict **whether a passenger survived or did not survive**

> In the **Cars** section we use a machine learning model to predict **The real price of a Car**

## **Titanic Test Data**

> You can use this data to predict if passenger survived
